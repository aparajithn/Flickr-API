# Flickr-API
This is an Android application written primarily in Kotlin, it makes use of the Flickr API to retrieve and display images. It displays them in a grid recycler view with 25 images per page
The application supports pagination by dynamic loading the images as you scroll through the recycler view.
The application also supports recent search history using the local cache
Selecting a thumbnail will allow the user to be taken to a different page which then supports zooming into/out of pictures



To run this application : 
Clone the repository into your local machine. 
Open up Android Studio and open the project you just cloned. 
You then should be able to run the application in an emulator or a physical device of your choosing
